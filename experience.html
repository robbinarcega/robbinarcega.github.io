          <h4>Community Manager</h4>
          <h6><a href="http://udemy.com" target="_new">Udemy</a>, San Francisco, CA | July 2016 - Present</h6>
        </div>

        <p>I currently manage two online communities of instructors. Together, there's nearly 45k members! I'm there to make sure instructor's voices are heard, and with my background in support, I also keep an eye on posts that might have a bug report. I also think of ways to engage the community by thinking up content that's relevant, accessible, and as fun as I can make it within reason. Considering my support background consisted of only students, the instructor audience is a new world to me, and I'm learning a lot every day.</p>

          <h4>Customer Support Associate/User Happiness Specalist</h4>
          <h6><a href="http://udemy.com" target="_new">Udemy</a>, San Francisco, CA | February 2014 - July 2016</h6>
        </div>

        <p>I started off my tech career as a customer support agent. This team was like the Night's Watch from <i>Game of Thrones</i> (which I know nothing about, please don't judge me - reason to follow in the "bookshop" portion of my experience). I was the first true support agent hired, and I trained everyone who came on after me up until I switched teams. Determined, I learned pretty much everything on my own (including SQL), wrote an entire Wiki of every single support process we had, and eventually was given a role within the team that focused on proactive support. I was an exterminator of tickets, resolving up to 100 tickets on my best days.</p>

          <h4>Bookseller/Supervisor</h4>
          <h6>Books Inc., San Francisco, CA | August 2011 - November 2013</h6>
        </div>

        <p>If I could, I'd live in a bookshop. That is essentially what I did with my time right out of college. This particular bookshop was located within Terminal 2 of SFO, and I woke up every day at 3:30am to sell people newspapers, magazines, and give detailed book recommendations for those who asked. I became a supervisor after only a few months of working there, and was given the role of Children's/YA Specalist. This meant I got to go to top-secret book conventions, talk with authors, help host events at other Books Inc. locations, and get more kids and young adults to read. It's pretty awesome to see people pick up books for their family members of the appropriate age, but it's a true victory when the kid themself gives me a nod of acceptance.</p>

          <h4>Teaching Assistant, Japanese Literature</h4>
          <h6>UC Davis, Davis, CA | March 2011 - June 2011</h6>
        </div>

        <p>There were two professors whose classes I loved the most. It was not surprising when I found out that they were actually a married couple, and then it made sense why these classes were equally good. I had the privilege of being Professor Wheeler's teaching assistant for her upper division Japanese courses, which was a fantastic period of time (both in the literature and in my life). I helped grade quizzes, read through essays, and learned so much about what it was like to be on the other side of the classroom. I had some experience with it before prior to this one, but being in a college class had an entirely different feel. Most of my peers were there because they were genuinely interested in the subject, and that made being a TA more fun and engaging.</p>

          <h4>Teaching Assistant, High School Japanese</h4>
          <h6>Davis High School, Davis, CA | January 2011 - March 2011</h6>
        </div>

        <p>While studying for an education minor, I was required to TA for one of the local high schools. I reached out to Mrs. Naoko McHale, who accepted me as one of her TAs. Because this was a subject I knew well (Japanese was one of my majors), I felt entirely comfortable helping students. At some point, the students and Mrs. McHale urged me to join the summer cultural festival. That summer, I learned the Japanese folk dance <i>Soran Bushi</i>, and participated with the class. I loved being able to work on something with the students of that class - they were some of the brightest, kindest people I've met, and I have no doubt they're working wonders today.</p>

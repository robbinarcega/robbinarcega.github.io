      <h1 class="tag name">Hi! My name is Robbin Arcega.</h1>
      <p class="tag location"><b>I'm a San Francisco-based UX designer and I love a good yarn.</b><br>If this were a Tinder profile, I'd talk about how I'm always learning something new and how much I love tea.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h4>As they say in Hamilton: "I'm young, scrappy and hungry, and I'm not throwing away my shot."</h4>
        <p>I've done web design a long time ago. I was 10 when I made my first website on Angelfire (I also had one on Geocities). I had no idea that web design would go anywhere beyond a hobby for me. Seventeen years later, I'm reteaching myself HTML and CSS, and my goal is to keep learning so I can build cool things. This site is one of my <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> projects.</p>
        <p>In addition to web design, I'm also an introverted people-person. I've done community management and support. I also help friends work out career-related things, like resume writing, interview tips from friends in the tech world, and more.</p>
        <p>I'm a huge fan of art of all kinds. I crochet, draw, and write. I'm also adept at tea tastings and can distinguish between five different Oriental Beauty teas from the same region but from five different farms. I'm basically an old lady trapped in a young person's body. Oh, and dogs are my favorite, despite my cat hat.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to be a master, not just in Pokemon, but also all aspects of web design, from user research to building a product. For now, these are the skills I possess, though I am learning something new every day:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
          <li>Community Management</li>
          <li>Customer Service</li>
          <li>User Interviews</li>
          <li>Data Analysis</li>
          <li>Problem Solving</li>
          <li>Training Hires</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Someday, Iâ€™d like to work for a web design company that wants to help bring more information to the world in a clear, concise manner. Kind of like a nyancat of information.</p>

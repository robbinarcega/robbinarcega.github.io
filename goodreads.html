        <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
          <p>GOODREADS: A “social cataloguing” website for books. Their mission: the right book in the right hands at the right time can change the world.</p>
          <p>Readers can share what they’re currently reading with millions of other bookish types around the world, track what they’re reading, get personalized recommendations, and see if a book is right for them based on community reviews.</p>

          <h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
          <p>They have a native app for both Android and iOS, but our goal is to make it to more user-friendly while retaining its robust feature list. For this specific project, we focused on the Android app as this was the only device available for testing. This was a personal project, and not one of the briefs that Designlab provided, so a brief was written for this project:</p>

          <h4>BEFORE + AFTER</h4>
          <p>The original app is on the top; alterations are on the bottom. However, this is just for a few of the screens of the app, and using the prototype is suggested.</p>
